### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Hackverse, please report it privately so we can investigate and address it:

1. **Where to report**
   Send an email to **[adithya25905@gmail.com](mailto:adithya25905@gmail.com)** with the subject line “Security Vulnerability Report” and include:

   * A clear description of the issue
   * Steps to reproduce (proof‑of‑concept if available)
   * Affected Hackverse version(s)

2. **Response timeline**
   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **72 hours** and keep you updated on progress.

3. **What to expect**

   * **Accepted vulnerabilities**: We will coordinate an agreed‑upon fix timeline, publish a security advisory, and release a patched version with credit to the reporter (unless you request anonymity).
   * **Declined reports**: If we determine the issue is not a vulnerability (e.g., intended behavior or out of scope), we will explain our reasoning and close the report.

4. **Public disclosure**
   Please allow at least **30 days** for us to prepare a public fix and advisory. If coordination exceeds this window, we will communicate estimated timelines.
